Steps and test cases to test the code

Test case 1-
1) Give the path of csv file to "path" variable in data_reporting.py file. Change '\' with '/' for complete path. 
2) Open command promt (cmd) and go to the path where data_report_server.py file is saved.
3) Run the data_report_server.py file first by typing, python data_report_server.py
4) It will listen and wait for the client for the connection to be established.
5) Open another command prompt (cmd) and go to the path where data_reporting.py file is saved.
6) Run the data_reporting.py file by typing, python data_reporting.py
7) Enter the threshold value for sensor 1, enter 120
8) Enter the threshod value for sensor 2, enter 1.5
9) Go back to server command prompt and check the result of transmitted values.
10) Note: First value is the timestamp and last 2 values are reported data point count for sensor 1 and sensor 2 respectively.

Test case 2-

1) Repeat steps 1 to 6 from test case 1.
2) Enter the threshold value for sensor 1, enter 100
3) Enter the threshod value for sensor 2, enter 0.5
4) Go back to server command prompt and check the result of transmitted values.

Test case 3-
1) Repeat steps 1 to 6 from test case 1.
2) Enter the threshold value for sensor 1, enter 150
3) Enter the threshod value for sensor 2, enter 2
4) Go back to server command prompt and check the result of transmitted values.
